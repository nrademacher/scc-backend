# SCC backend

A GraphQL server powered by Express, Apollo Server, TypeScript, and using Prisma as an ORM/ODM for MongoDB.

It's set up to split functionality into loosely coupled `modules`, so that the API is easy to extend and maintain.

Note: This is based on a [previous learning project of mine](https://github.com/nrademacher/pulse-api)
